This is simply my website. I have uploaded both my front end and back end codes.

I am learning MEAN stack and this is my first project. There is not much to say. ~~I haven't uploaded it to a server yet, so I can't show you how it looks. Hopefully I will get one soon.~~

After few hours of debugging, it's finally up at: http://web-forthright48.rhcloud.com/.

Maybe I will get a domain name next.
